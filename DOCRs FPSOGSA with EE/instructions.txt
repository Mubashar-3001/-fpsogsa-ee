
Steps for running code to get Global best values.
1.	Open all 5 .m files in matlab
2.	Open main.m file, set N values (number of out comes), also set number of iterations for 1 run 
3.	Also set Benchmark_Function_ID (ID will be set according to IEEE bus)
4.	Now open main code.m file set number of runs (for good and precise result put maximum number of runs)
5.	Also change the name of data base (i.e, save dataset_DOCR_3bus_FPSOGSA_EE_a=36.mat) for different data data base name will be changed.
6.	Open bench mark function.m file to select and set IEEE bus settings (set TMS and PTS values)
7.	Now open bench mark functions details. M files to set the dimensions and boundries for each relay (i.e upper and lower limits) 
8.	Now open FPSOGSA.m file to select alpha value (a=xx), for FPSOGSA put Alpha from 0.1 to 0.9, for PSOGSA put alpha value =1 
9.	Now run main.m code for different values of alpha to get different results.
10.	After each run a values will be generated (x and y values) in works space, collect all the values for results.
Note that: for each run change folder name (check step no 3).
